/* 
Pixels(px) - Absolute Unit
- One pixel is equal to one dot on the computer screen (the smallest division of a screen).
- most common unit for setting font sizes.
- 96px = 1 inch means 1px = 1/96 inch
- not suitable for responsive websites. Because the size of the pixel is fixed and does not change with the size of the browser window.
- font-size: 20px;
